# Book Search Engine Refactor
## Description
This is a book search engine where a user can search for any book or series they desire to read. The user has to either login or sign-up to actually be able to save books. The main purpose of this project was to refactor the code from a RESTful API to use Apollo Server and GraphQL instead. 
## Usage
The usage of the app is simple. 
1. Follow the link to the deployed app
2. Login or Sign Up
3. Search for any book or series
4. Select a book to save and it will be saved in your books page
5. Navigate to your saved books page and there you can view and delete your saved books
